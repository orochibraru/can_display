# Verifying and extending the GT86 CAN decoders

## Why this matters

The IDs and formulas in `internal/canbus/gt86` come from community
reverse-engineering (see the source link in that package's doc comment),
not from Toyota/Subaru factory documentation. They have **not** been
verified against this specific car. Treat every value as "probably
right, please confirm" before trusting anything the dash shows you —
especially before making driving decisions based on it.

## What's already wired up

| Signal | Status |
|---|---|
| RPM | Decoded from `0x140` bytes 2-3, 14-bit little-endian, no scaling. Unverified on this car. (`0x141` bytes 4-5 carries a second copy, per the same source, if this one needs cross-checking.) |
| Coolant temp | Decoded from `0x360` byte 3, `value - 40`°C. Unverified on this car. |
| Oil temp | Decoded from `0x360` byte 2, `value - 40`°C. Unverified on this car. |
| AFR | Polled via OBD-II Mode 01 PID 0x24 (standard, not reverse-engineered) from the factory wideband sensor. Whether this ECU actually answers it hasn't been confirmed — see the dedicated section below. |
| Battery voltage | **Not found** in any factory-bus reverse-engineering doc so far. Needs new reverse-engineering work (see below). |
| Ethanol % | Not on CAN at all — read from a locally-wired analog sensor instead. See `docs/wiring.md` and `internal/sensors`. |

## How to check (or find) an ID

You don't need this project's hardware to do this — any cheap USB-CAN
adapter (e.g. an $8 "CANable"-clone, or even another MCP2515 board on a
breadboard talking to a laptop) plus `candump`/`cansniffer`
(linux `can-utils`) or [SavvyCAN](https://www.savvycan.com/) (cross
platform, nicer UI) works.

1. Connect to the OBD-II port, pins 6 (CAN H) and 14 (CAN L).
2. With the engine idling and everything electrically "boring" (no
   accessories being toggled), log a minute or two of traffic.
3. To find a specific signal: change *one thing* at a time and diff the
   log against a baseline.
   - RPM: this is the easiest one to sanity-check — rev the engine and
     watch bytes 2-3 of `0x140` count up and back down in step with the
     tach. If they don't, it's worth trying bytes 4-5 of `0x141`
     instead (the same value is supposedly duplicated there).
   - Coolant/oil temp: compare a cold start against 5 minutes of idling
     — the target bytes should climb steadily as the values in
     `0x360` are expected to (byte 2 and 3, `raw - 40` = °C). If they
     don't match on your car, `cansniffer` (which highlights bytes
     that change) makes this fast to spot.
   - Battery voltage: turn on/off a big electrical load (headlights,
     rear defroster) and watch for a byte that dips and recovers by
     roughly the right amount (idle ~14.2V, load ~13.5-13.8V).
4. Once you've found a candidate ID/byte/formula, add a decoder in
   `internal/canbus/gt86/gt86.go` following the pattern of
   `decodeTemperatures`, and register it in `Register()`.
5. Update the status table above and the comment citing your source
   (even if the source is "captured myself on <date>, see <log file>")
   so the next person (including future you) knows what's actually been
   confirmed versus copied from a forum post.

## Verifying AFR (OBD-II PID 0x24)

This one's worth checking *before* wiring up the real hardware, since
it's easy to test with tools that already exist:

1. Get any ELM327-based OBD-II adapter (a $10 Bluetooth/USB one is
   fine) and a laptop.
2. Use [python-OBD](https://python-obd.readthedocs.io/) or a generic
   PID-request tool to send Mode 01 PID 0x24 and see if you get a
   response at all. python-OBD has this PID built in as
   `obd.commands.O2_S1_WR_VOLTAGE` / equivalence-ratio commands --
   easier than crafting raw CAN frames by hand for a first check.
3. If you get a response: note whether it came back on the standard
   `0x7E8` address or something else, and roughly how long it took --
   `afrPollInterval` in `internal/canbus/gt86/afr.go` assumes the ECU
   can keep up with a request every 250ms; slow it down if not.
4. If a functional-broadcast request (`0x7DF`, what this project sends
   by default) gets no response, try a *physical* request to `0x7E0`
   instead (the engine ECU's usual address) -- some ECUs are picky
   about which addressing mode they answer. That'd mean changing
   `obd2.FunctionalRequestID` to `0x7E0` for this specific request (or
   generalizing `Poller`/`RequestFrame` to take a target ID per
   request, if you want both addressing modes available at once).
5. Sanity check the actual number: with the engine warm and idling,
   AFR should hover close to 14.7 (lambda ~1.0). If it's stuck at 0,
   pegged at max, or wildly implausible, something in the request
   format or response parsing doesn't match this ECU -- compare
   against what your OBD-II tool captured in step 2-3 byte-for-byte
   against `obd2.RequestFrame`/`ParseSingleFrameResponse`.

## Adding an aftermarket AFR source instead

The OBD-II route only gets you what the factory sensor's ECU-side
scaling allows (reportedly capped around 12.2:1 rich, per community
reports -- see `afr.go`'s doc comment). If that turns out to be too
limiting, or PID 0x24 doesn't work on this car at all, a standalone
wideband controller broadcasting onto CAN (Haltech, AEM, etc. all have
documented CAN broadcast protocols) is the fallback: find its frame
layout, write a decoder with the same shape as `decodeTemperatures`,
and `reg.Register(id, decoder)` it -- same pattern as everything else
in `gt86.go`, no changes needed anywhere else in the pipeline.

## Adding an aftermarket ethanol source

Same idea, if you'd rather get ethanol % over CAN from an aftermarket
controller than through the local analog sensor this project currently
reads (`internal/sensors`): find the controller's documented frame
layout and register a decoder the same way.
