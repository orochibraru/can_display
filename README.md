# can_display

A DIY CAN bus gauge cluster for a 2015 Toyota GT86, built in TinyGo for
a Raspberry Pi Pico W(H) + SPI TFT display.

The project is split so the dashboard UI can be built and iterated on
without a car, a Pico, or any wiring at all:

`cmd/simulator` and `cmd/firmware` both render the _exact same_
`internal/ui.Dashboard` — the simulator is a true preview, not a
lookalike. Only pin wiring and how frames arrive (real MCP2515 vs. a
fake generator) differ between the two.

## Quick start

```sh
make sim        # opens a desktop window with the live dashboard, fake data
make vet         # go vet the shared/simulator code + tinygo-build-check the firmware
make test        # unit tests for the hardware-agnostic packages
make firmware    # cross-compile firmware to bin/firmware.uf2 (needs tinygo)
make flash       # build + flash onto a Pico W held in BOOTSEL (needs tinygo)
```

Requires [Go](https://go.dev) and, for the firmware targets,
[TinyGo](https://tinygo.org) (`brew tap tinygo-org/tools && brew install
tinygo` on macOS).

## Hardware this targets

- Raspberry Pi Pico W / WH (RP2040)
- ST7789 V2.2 2.0" 240x320 SPI TFT display
- MCP2515 SPI CAN controller module, wired to the OBD-II port's CAN H/L
  (pins 6/14)
- An analog (0.5V-4.5V) flex-fuel sensor for ethanol %, read through
  a resistor divider on the Pico's own ADC (see `docs/wiring.md`)

The CAN IDs/formulas in use come from community reverse-engineering,
not factory documentation — **do not trust them blindly**. See
[`docs/can-reverse-engineering.md`](docs/can-reverse-engineering.md)
for how to verify them on your own car (and how to add the missing
ones) with a cheap USB-CAN adapter. AFR is a different kind of
unverified — see `internal/canbus/gt86/afr.go`'s doc comment.

The simulator defaults to previewing all six tiles, including battery
(no data source at all yet), so the layout can be designed before that
hardware exists. Flip `Enable*` off in `cmd/simulator/main.go`'s
`main()` to see exactly what the firmware can show today.

## Design notes

- **`internal/display.Display`** is a type alias for
  `tinygo.org/x/drivers.Displayer`. Any TinyGo display driver satisfies
  it for free, and the simulator's software framebuffer satisfies it
  too — so `internal/ui` never needs to know which one it's talking to.
- **`internal/sensors`** holds conversion math for locally-wired analog
  sensors (currently just ethanol %) — the non-CAN counterpart to
  `internal/canbus/gt86`. Pure functions, no hardware access, so the
  voltage-divider and sensor-curve math is unit tested without needing
  a board or a multimeter.
- **Text rendering** uses `tinygo.org/x/tinyfont` (`freesans`) on both
  targets, on purpose — the simulator should look pixel-for-pixel like
  the real panel, not just "similar."
- **`internal/canbus.Registry`** dispatches frames to decoders by ID.
  The firmware feeds it real MCP2515 frames; a future `internal/sim`
  addition could replay a `candump` log through the same interface for
  regression testing against real captures.
- **`internal/canbus/obd2`** implements the request/response half of
  CAN (ISO 15765-4 Mode 01 PIDs), for signals like AFR that the ECU
  only sends if asked, as opposed to `gt86`'s passively-broadcast IDs.
  A `canbus.Writer` (separate from the read-only `canbus.Bus`, since
  most sources here can't transmit) is what makes sending a request
  possible in the first place.
- **`internal/ui/config.go`** is the one file to edit to retune what
  counts as normal/warning/danger for any gauge (idle RPM redline,
  coolant/oil temp limits, etc.) — `dashboard.go` just wires those
  values into tiles and shouldn't need to change alongside them.
- Tests live in `tests/` as an external package, so they only see
  exported API.
- Every package under `internal/` builds with plain `go build`/`go
test` — only `cmd/firmware` needs TinyGo (it's gated behind a
  `//go:build tinygo` tag so `go build ./...` from the repo root
  doesn't try and fail to compile it).
