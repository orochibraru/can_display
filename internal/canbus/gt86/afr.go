// AFR comes from the factory wide-range A/F sensor via standard OBD-II
// Mode 01 PID 0x24 (O2 Sensor 1, equivalence ratio) -- NOT from a
// passively-broadcast CAN ID like coolant/oil temp is. The ECU only
// sends this in response to an explicit request, which is why the
// firmware also needs to run an obd2.Poller (see AFRPoller) in
// parallel with the passive canbus.Registry the rest of this package's
// decoders rely on.
//
// This is more speculative than this package's other decoders, in a
// different way than "the ID might be wrong":
//   - PID 0x24 itself is a standard, SAE J1979-documented PID, not
//     reverse-engineered guesswork -- the wire format is solid.
//   - Whether *this* ECU actually replies usefully to it over the
//     OBD-II port hasn't been confirmed here -- Toyota's exact
//     ISO-15765 addressing/timing on this platform is unverified. If
//     FunctionalRequestID gets no response, try a physical request to
//     0x7E0 instead (see obd2.FunctionalRequestID's doc comment).
//   - Even if it works: multiple independent sources (EcuTek's own
//     docs among them) report the factory sensor's ECU-side scaling
//     can't show richer than ~12.2:1 (0.83 lambda). Fine for
//     cruise/part-throttle monitoring, not for reading a rich WOT pull
//     accurately.

// gasolineStoichAFR is the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio for pure
// gasoline (lambda 1.0). It shifts with ethanol content (E85 is closer
// to 9.8:1); this doesn't correct for that yet, so AFR will read a bit
// rich-of-actual on high-ethanol blends. Worth revisiting once
// EthanolPercent (internal/sensors) is reliably online, since both
// numbers would then be available at once.

// registerAFR installs.
